# MOT_deepsort
====

Dependencies:
----
The code is compatible with Python 2.7 and 3. The following dependencies are needed to run the tracker:
NumPy
sklearn
OpenCV
Additionally, feature generation requires TensorFlow (>= 1.0).

Introduction:
----
Matching detections USES traditional Hungarian algorithms
The fusion measure is used in calculating the match between detections and tracks.Including kalman filter prediction and observation location in markov distance in space and the bounding boxes between apparent characteristics of cosine distance.

Training the model:
----
We have two trained models for reference under the pathes of:
MOT_deepsort\deep_sort_tracker\networks\
